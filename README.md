# Personal Portfolio Website

## Summary:
This was my first major experience creating a website using HTML and CSS to create a personal professional landing page to connect with peers and other industry professionals.

## What I Learned:
* It is essential to stay organized and have clear goal of what elements I want displayed on the screen.
* Don't try to code CSS stylesheets at the end but gradually build them while adding HTML elements.
* Double check the output before moving on to the next task.
