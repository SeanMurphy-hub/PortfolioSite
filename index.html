				Thank you for visiting my personal website! I will be developing this site more in the near future but first let me tell you a little about myself.
				I am originally from West Des Moines, Iowa and upon graduating high school I served in the U.S. Navy as an Information Systems Technician for seven years. 
				My time in the Navy allowed me to gain hands on experience working with a wide array of IT systems in addition telecommunications equipment. Currently, I am 
				a student at the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa and I will be graduating with a BBA in Business Analytics and Information Systems 
				in May 2022. After graduation I plan on seeking employment in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metro area and am looking forward to bringing my experience and 
				skills to a position in which I can thrive. Feel free to checkout my LinkedIn and GitHub sites linked above to view my past projects and I hope to hear from you!
